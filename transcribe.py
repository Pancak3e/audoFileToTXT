## 🚀 About Me

I build end-to-end workflow systems for automotive repair operations, including:

- Mobile applications  
- Full-stack web apps  
- AWS-powered backend automation  
- AI-based inspection & estimate tools  
- Chrome extensions  
- Media upload pipelines  
- Real-time shop productivity utilities  

My work has been used daily inside high-volume auto repair facilities to:

- Reduce estimate writing time from 30 minutes → **30 seconds**  
- Automate inspection media handling  
- Consolidate ROs, communications, and advisor tools  
- Improve throughput, accuracy, and consistency  

I specialize in **React, Node.js, Python, AWS, iOS**, and workflow automation that solves painful real-world problems.
